Organizing Your Sidebar
=======================

You can manage and customize channels in your sidebar to better support how you use Mattermost. Any customizations you make you to your sidebar affects only your Mattermost instance. 

Your new sidebar is set up as follows by default:
- All of the channels you've joined display in a **Channels** category, and all channels are sorted in alphabetical order.
- All Direct Messages display in a **Direct Messages** category below channels, and all Direct Messages are sorted by recent activity.

What's customizable in your sidebar?
------------------------------------

You can choose to customize your sidebar in the following ways:
- Group and order channels into categories customized just for you.
- Mute and unmute entire categories or mute and unmute selected channels or Direct Messages.
- Sort category channels manually, alphabetically, or by recent activity.
- Group unread messages into an **Unreads** category.
- Control how many Direct Message conversations to display.
- Control how Direct Messages are sorted.

Creating custom categories

2. Type a category name, then select **Create**.
3. Drag any channels into this new category. You can also multi-select channels to drag them together as a group.

**Your custom categories are collapsible.**
- When collapsed, only unread channels display to reduce unnecessary scrolling.

**Your can organize your custom categories.**
- Drag to reorder entire categories to prioritize important conversations. 

**Your custom categories can contain Direct Message conversations.**

Renaming categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Select the **Category options** icon [image], then select **Rename Category**.
2. Type a new category name, then select **Rename**.

Deleting categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Select sequential channels and/or Direct Messages by pressing and holding SHIFT. 
- Select non-sequential channels and/or Direct Messages by pressing and holding CMD (for Mac) or CTRL (for Windows/Linux). 
- To clear channel or Direct Message selections, press ESC.

Muting and unmuting categories
------------------------------

When you mute or unmute a category, all channels within that category are also muted or unmuted. 

Select the **Channel options** icon [image], then select **Mute Category**.

Once a category is muted:

- Email, desktop, and push notifications are disabled for all channels in the category.
- A mute icon displays next to each channel name in the category.
- The category and all of its channels are greyed out in the left-hand sidebar. Channels in the category aren't marked as unread unless you’re mentioned directly.
- You can selectively unmute specific channels within the category.

To unmute the category, select the **Channel options** icon [image], then select **Unmute Category**.

Sorting category channels
-------------------------

Using the Mattermost Web or Desktop App, you can control how channels are sorted for each category. Sort category channels manually (by dragging and dropping), alphabetically, or by recent conversations first.

Select the **Category options** icon [image], then select **Sort** and choose from **Alphabetically**, **Recent Activity**, or **Manually**.

Grouping unread messages
------------------------

Catch up on all your unread channels in one place at the top of your sidebar with a one-click **Unreads** category.

Go to **Main Menu > Account Settings > Sidebar**, set **Group unread channels separately** to **On**, then select **Save**.
- When this setting is enabled, all unread messages appear only in the **Unreads** category.
- When this setting is disabled, all unread messages appear within their respective categories and channels.

When enabled, the **Unreads** category is organized as follows:
- Unread messages that contain mentions are sorted to the top by most recent activity.
- Unread messages that do not contain mentions are sorted by most recent and appear directly below unread messages containing mentions.
- Muted channels that contain mentions are sorted by most recent and appear directly below unread messages without mentions.

.. tip::
  If you prefer to see a decicated unread-only view in your new sidebar, collapse all custom categories to show only unread messages, then disable **Grouping unread messages** under **Account Settings > Sidebar**.

----------------------------

Sort your Direct Messages alphabetically or by recent conversations first.

Select the **Channel options** icon [image], then select **Sort** and choose from **Alphabetically** or **Recent Activity**.

Controlling how many Direct Message conversations to display
------------------------------------------------------------

Control how many Direct Message conversations display in the **Direct Messages* category to keep your conversations manageable. You can choose to show all messages or a fixed number of messages.

You can configure the number of Direct Messages to display in one of two ways:
- Go to **Main Menu > Account Settings > Sidebar**, then set **Number of direct messages to show**.
- Select the **Channel options** icon [image], then select **Show**

Choose from **All direct messages**, or choose to show **10**, **15**, **20**, or **40** messages.

Once you exceed the number of Direct Messages configured, older messages are hidden from the **Direct Messages** category. Increaes the number of conversations displayed to see older Direct Messages.

.. note::
  Any direct message conversations you've added to custom categories do not count against the maximum number of conversations shown in the **Direct Messages** category.

Mobile support for this feature is coming in a future release.
